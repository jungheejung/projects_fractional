# task description

## a. Memory encoding-recall task:

This task investigates memory processes, benchmarking canonical encoding-memory recall tasks. Participants studied items during the encoding phase and identified old vs. new items during the test phase. Using functional alignment, we can test if such algorithms improve the decodability of memory processes, and use the accuracy scores as ground truth for model validation.

## b. Theory of mind task

This task investigates mentalization processes. We administered two theory of mind tasks: 
1) false-belief stories and false-physical stories; 
2) categorization of images into mentalization or social body parts, which induces participants to reason about the mental states of others

## c. Attention task

This task investigates attentional processes, using three phases: fixation phase, cue phase, and target search phase. Participants reported the location of the target, as a function of valid and invalid cues. The goal is to see whether functional alignment improves the decodability of attentional processes; An additional goal is to use the accuracy scores as ground truth for model validation.
