# task description

## a. Memory encoding-recall task:

This task investigates memory processes, benchmarking canonical encoding-memory recall tasks. Participants studied items during the encoding phase and identified old vs. new items during the test phase. Using functional alignment, we can test if such algorithms improve the decodability of memory processes, and use the accuracy scores as ground truth for model validation.
* Number of trials: 2 blocks of 26 encoding trials / 40 test trials
* IV: 1) Encoding phase & Memory retrieval phase, 2) Old vs. New items
* DV: Old/New response, Reaction time, Accuracy

## b. Theory of mind task

This task investigates mentalization processes. We administered two theory of mind tasks: 
1) false-belief stories and false-physical stories; 

* number of trials: 20 trials
* IV: False belief vs. False photograph
* DV: True/False answer, Reaction time, Accuracy

2) categorization of images into mentalization or social body parts, which induces participants to reason about the mental states of others

* Number of trials: 256 trials 
* IV: 1) Why vs. How 2) Face vs. Hand
* DV: Yes/No answer, Reaction time, Accuracy


## c. Attention task

This task investigates attentional processes, using three phases: fixation phase, cue phase, and target search phase. Participants reported the location of the target, as a function of valid and invalid cues. The goal is to see whether functional alignment improves the decodability of attentional processes; An additional goal is to use the accuracy scores as ground truth for model validation.

* Number of trials: 120 trials, 
* IV: Valid vs. Invalid cue
* DV: Target detection Right/Left, Reaction time, Accuracy
